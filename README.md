# Rust-BLS-Crypto
A Rust Implementation of BLS (Bonet-Lynn-Shacham) Signature Aggregation. This library was developed specifically as implementation
as part of a larger Byzantine-Fault-Tolerance Schema title LeaderLess Byzantine Fault Tolerance (LBFT). The speicfic design goals of 
LBFT are set in an attempt to provide Byzantine Fault tolerance in with O(n) message complexity rather than O(n^2) or potentially O(n^3)
of both PBFT anf BFT.

# Errors in development

At this moment this library is still being developed, the only errors occuring are related to the Rust Library and Crate Systen. The core functions
and source code functions without error, and can be utilized at will.
